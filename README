A very simple regex engine written as a learning project, based on the theory described here: http://perl.plover.com/Regex/article.html

An example regex: I [don't ]?like [[Hormel |Spamco ]?spam|bacon|eggs][ for [breakfast|lunch|dinner]]?.

Syntax:

[foo]? makes foo optional
[foo|bar] is a choice between foo and bar

Options and choices can be nested, as in the example.

statechartviz.py is a nodebox (http://nodebox.net) script which visualizes the state charts which the engine creates from regular expressions; statechartviz.(pdf|png) is a visualization of the above example regex.
